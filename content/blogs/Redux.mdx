## Introduction

In this first blog, I will go through one of the topics that I struggled with a lot: **Redux Basics**.

## Why You Should Read This?

This will be a shortened version of the <a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#redux-toolkit"  >docs</a>, so you don't need to go through the whole documentation, I did that for you here. It will also include some personal notes that helped me understand Redux, and hopefully, they will help you too.

## What is Redux?

Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating global application state. The UI triggers events called **actions** to describe what happened, and separate update logic called **reducers** updates the state in response.

Redux serves as a **centralized store** for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a **predictable** fashion.

## Redux Libraries and Tools

### **Redux Toolkit**

Redux Toolkit is the recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It contains packages and functions that are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit:

- Builds in suggested best practices.
- Simplifies most Redux tasks.
- Prevents common mistakes.
- Makes it easier to write Redux applications.

### **React-Redux**

Redux can integrate with any UI framework, but it is most frequently used with **React**. The official package for this is **React-Redux**, which allows React components to interact with a Redux store by:

- Reading pieces of state.
- Dispatching actions to update the store.

### **Redux DevTools Extension**

The **Redux DevTools Extension** shows a **history** of changes to the state in your Redux store over time, allowing you to debug your applications effectively.

## Immutability vs. Mutability

JavaScript supports two types of variable declarations: **Primitive** and **Non-Primitive**.

### **Primitive Data Types (Stored by Value)**

- Stored directly in **stack memory**.
- When assigned to a new variable, a **copy** of the value is made.
- **Immutable** (cannot be changed after creation).

#### **JavaScript Data**

```
+---------------------------+
|     JavaScript Data      |
+---------------------------+
|  Primitive Data Types    | <---- Immutable & stored by value
|  (Stored directly in stack)  |
|---------------------------|
|  Number                  |
|  String                   |
|  Boolean                 |
|  Null                    |
|  Undefined               |
|  Symbol                  |
|  BigInt                  |
+---------------------------+
```

#### **Example:**

```js
let a = 10;
let b = a; // A copy of `a` is assigned to `b`
b = 20;

console.log(a); // 10 (unchanged)
console.log(b); // 20 (separate copy)
```

### **Non-Primitive Data Types (Stored by Reference)**

- Stored in **heap memory**, but the variable holds a **reference (address)** in the stack.
- When assigned to a new variable, the **reference** is copied, not the actual value.
- **Mutable** (modifying one reference modifies all references).

#### **JavaScript Data**

```
+---------------------------+
|  Non-Primitive Data Types | <---- Mutable & stored by reference
|  (Stored in heap, ref in stack) |
|---------------------------|
|  Object                  |
|  Array                    |
|  Function                 |
|  Date                     |
|  RegExp                   |
+---------------------------+
```

#### **Example:**

```js
let obj1 = { name: "Amir" };
let obj2 = obj1; // Both point to the same object in memory

obj2.name = "Ali";

console.log(obj1.name); // "Ali" (changed because obj1 and obj2 reference the same object)
console.log(obj2.name); // "Ali"
```

## Immutability

JavaScript objects and arrays are **mutable** by default. If you create an object or array, you can modify its contents:

```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
// still the same object outside, but the contents have changed
obj.b = 3;

const arr = ["a", "b"];
// In the same way, we can change the contents of this array
arr.push("c");
arr[1] = "d";
```

This is called **mutating** the object or array. The reference remains the same, but the contents inside the object change.

To update values **immutably**, you must make **copies** of existing objects/arrays and modify the copies:

```js
let arr1 = ["a", "b"];
let arr2 = ["c", "d"];
let arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(arr3); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```

React and Redux **require** immutable updates. We'll explore this more later.

## Important Terminology

### **Action**

An **action** is a plain JavaScript object with a **type** field, describing an event in the app.

```js
const addTodoAction = {
  type: "todos/todoAdded",
  payload: "Buy milk",
};
```

### **Action Creators**

An **action creator** is a function that returns an action object:

```js
const addTodo = (text) => ({
  type: "todos/todoAdded",
  payload: text,
});
```

### **Reducers**

A **reducer** is a function that updates the state based on an action:

```js
const initialState = { value: 0 };

function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  if (action.type === "counter/increment") {
    return { ...state, value: state.value + 1 };
  }
  return state;
}
```

### **Store**

The **store** holds the Redux state:

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterReducer });
console.log(store.getState()); // { value: 0 }
```

### **Dispatch**

To update state, **dispatch** an action:

```js
store.dispatch({ type: "counter/increment" });
console.log(store.getState()); // { value: 1 }
```

### **Selectors**

Selectors extract specific values from the store:

```js
const selectCounterValue = (state) => state.value;
const currentValue = selectCounterValue(store.getState());
console.log(currentValue); // 2
```

| REDUX FLOW OVERVIEW              |
+----------------------------------+

1. INITIAL SETUP
   +----------------------------+
   | Redux store is created    |
   | with a root reducer       |
   +----------------------------+
   | Store calls reducer once  |
   | and sets initial state    |
   +----------------------------+
   | UI renders based on state |
   | and subscribes to updates |
   +----------------------------+

2. UPDATES (STATE CHANGES)
   +----------------------------+
   | User interacts with UI    |
   | (e.g., clicks a button)   |
   +----------------------------+
   | Action is dispatched      |
   | (e.g., { type: 'INCREMENT' }) |
   +----------------------------+
   | Store runs reducer with   |
   | previous state & action   |
   +----------------------------+
   | New state is saved        |
   +----------------------------+
   | UI components subscribed  |
   | to store are notified     |
   +----------------------------+
   | Components check if data  |
   | they depend on changed    |
   +----------------------------+
   | Components re-render      |
   | with new state data       |
   +----------------------------+
```
