This will be a short one, but I just wanted to include it as a small link reference or cheat sheet.

It has happened to most of us that we stepped up on a website that design is just way too good that makes and feels like futuristic or just a pure design and not a developed website by a frontend developer.

I felt like this could be a difficult development and design task to implement those unique visual features in a framework like React and using per say Tailwind, but I came up on a fantastic website that is a collection of UI components that have effects and animations, and best of all it is free. I have used it and highly recommend it to check it out.

The second website I wanted to mention in this post is kind of a social media of creative people that uses AI to create astonishing designs and components, you can browse, create, and share your own design.

One unique feature that I found in this website that I did not see elsewhere is the fact that the publisher of the designs shares the prompt they have used to get that result, and you can get the prompt and modify it as you want, definitely a good starting point for getting inspiration from other creative people and maybe share yours.

The last one is not as comprehensive as the others but still worth mentioning as I have used it a handful of times, you may come across those websites that have a dotted or grid style background, this repo has some of those techniques included to get the same effect on your background, and the good point at least for me was that it was all in Tailwind, definitely worth a try.

Hope you use them and create some nice looking futuristic websites.
