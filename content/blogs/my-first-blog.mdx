# What is this blog?

I simply created this blog to share my struggles and the way I broke them down and understood them. I will be mostly writing about React, TypeScript, JavaScript, and some general knowledge about AWS services and their use cases.

I personally have a hard time understanding advanced topics ðŸ™„, and that is mostly because resources lack the teaching phase even though they may have good content. Most video courses just focus on trendy technologies and some fancy out-of-the-box solutions just to catch the attentionâ€”and, of course, moneyâ€”of the end user. Some books and documentation are way too boringðŸ˜´ or too technical to read. This is why I want to share the knowledge from my point of view. The way I understood it may not be the best technical explanation or the fanciest technology out there, but it will be an easy read to follow.

If you encounter any issues, please let me know via the contact section or my social mediaðŸ“ž.

Let's go ðŸš€
