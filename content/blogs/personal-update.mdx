# Quick Life Update

## Why I’ve Been Away

I have not been around for some time due to a variety of reasons.

I have started my Master’s thesis, and it took a long time working on the proposal, getting the approval, and starting the actual implementation. It is going to be an implementation of an AI-based data ingestion system, hybrid retrieval, and an accessible AI-powered representation lawyer for a European institutional chain between universities. It’s a ton of work figuring out the correct structure and conducting the research in an academic way for writing my paper.

All of this is alongside my day-to-day full-time job (where most of my stress and energy is spent) and my personal life, which is going through its toughest time ever. But I’m standing strong, focusing, planning, and getting things done, because that’s what I do best.

## Plans and Goals for 2026

I just want to share with whoever is reading this what my plans and goals are for 2026. First and foremost, I have to finish my Master’s. Then I need to focus on boosting my technical skill set. I have been working in microservices environments and backend services, and this is where I see myself going in the next five years.

People always tell me that I should specialize. It’s nice that I handle whatever comes across my desk, no matter how unfamiliar it is, and figure it out, but I should specialize. From here, I want to share my answer.

My specialization will be becoming a full-stack software engineer specialized in cloud services. It’s a mouthful of a title, and I may not be 100% there yet, but I will be. I have a plan, books to read, and projects to build, and there is nothing that I cannot achieve. I’m looking forward to getting my Solutions Architect certification as soon as possible.

I also need to focus on getting my German B1 certificate. After all, I have been living here for almost three years, and now it’s time to integrate on a deeper level with the locals and communicate more. Believe me, being here and tolerating the weather is already a lot, and not being able to speak normally and express yourself makes it even harder. So I need to fix this.

At the end, I need to focus more on my personal health and include regular exercise in my routine.

So yeah, I have been going through a lot, and that is why I was away for a bit. But I will make a strong comeback once I settle all this.

Ciao 🍻
